# Lite - Liberos

An e-commerce platform to connect university students with each other that belong to the same university. </br>
* It follows **User-Modeling theory** along with **Iterative design approach of HCI** to deliver customer needs.
* Include proper flow of website, size and placement of views, detailed display of products and dashboard feature.

## Technologies Used:
* ReactJS
* HTML + CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

* Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload if you make edits.
* You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

* Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

* Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

** Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back! **

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Contributing

We love contributions. That out of the way, an average
contribution would involve the following:

1. Fork this repository in your account.
2. Clone it on your local machine.
3. Add a new remote using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AmanJee-BITS/E-Commerce_Website`.
4. Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b my-feature`.
5. Make your changes.
6. Commit your changes.
7. Rebase your commits with `upstream/master`:
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git fetch upstream master`
  - `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`
  - `git checkout my-feature`
  - `git rebase master`
8. Resolve any merge conflicts, and then push the branch with `git push origin my-feature`.
9. Create a Pull Request detailing the changes you made and wait for review/merge.

It might seem a little complicated at a glance, but the fundamental concept is simple: we
want to ensure that your changes are always made on top of the latest changes to the
project and thus, we can easily merge your code.

### Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message:

- is written in the imperative (e.g., "Fix ...", "Add ...")
- is kept short, while concisely explaining what the commit does.
- is clear about what part of the code is affected -- often by prefixing with the name of the subsystem and a colon, like "server: ..." or "docs: ...".
- is a complete sentence, ending with a period.
